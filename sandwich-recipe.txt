You know the deal.
Step 1 -> Take two loaves of bread. heat them on a pan on stove if you'd like. Maybe add a little bit of butter or ghee.
Step 2 -> Now add some aloo bhujiya to it (not the haldiram's one).
Step 3 -> Add chopped onions and some tomoato ketchup.
Step 4 -> Heat on the pan. 
Eat and enjoy! :-)
